# chainable - AI-Powered C2C Fulfilment

**Smarter returns through direct customer-to-customer shipping.**

Chainable connects customers who want to return a product (customer A) with other customers who want to buy the exact same item (customer B). The product is shipped directly from customer A to B. Custoemr B receives a discount, while the platform eliminates warehouse and logistics costs. AI handles the matching, and Stripe Connect secures the payment via escrow.
