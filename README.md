# chainable - AI-Powered C2C Fulfilment

**Smarter returns through direct customer-to-customer shipping.**

Match & Send connects customers who want to return a product with other customers who want to buy the exact same item. The product is shipped directly from one customer to another. The buyer receives a discount, while the platform eliminates warehouse and logistics costs. AI handles the matching, and Stripe Connect secures the payment via escrow.
